✨Bash✨ is a [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) and [command language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_language) written by [Brian Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)) for the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project) as a [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) replacement for the [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell). First released in 1989, it has been used as the default [login](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login) shell for most [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distributions. Bash was one of the first programs [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) ported to Linux, alongside [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection). A version is also available for [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Operating_System) 10 via the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux). It is also the default user shell in [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)) 11. Bash was also the default shell in all versions of [Apple macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) prior to the 2019 release of [macOS Catalina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Catalina), which changed the default shell to [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsh), although Bash remains available as an alternative shell.
